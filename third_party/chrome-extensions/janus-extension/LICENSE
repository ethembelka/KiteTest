This is the Meetecho extension utility for screensharing support in the Janus WebRTC gateway

Janus (http://janus.conf.meetecho.com) is an open source, general purpose WebRTC gateway developed by Meetecho.

Among its several features, it also allows users to share their screen or one of their applications with several attendees.

For security reasons, screen/application sharing with WebRTC needs an extension to be installed: this extension provides such a security mechanism for usage with the Janus gateway.

Test it with the online demo (http://janus.conf.meetecho.com/screensharingtest.html) or with any installation of Janus you made yourself.
